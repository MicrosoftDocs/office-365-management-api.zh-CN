# Office 365 Management APIs

The Office 365 Management APIs provide a single extensibility platform for all Office 365 customers' and partners' management tasks, including service communications, security, compliance, reporting, and auditing. All of the Office 365 Management APIs are consistent in design and implementation with the current suite of Office 365 REST APIs, using common industry-standard approaches, including OAuth v2, OData v4, and JSON. Like the other Office 365 APIs, applications are registered in Azure Active Directory, giving developers a consistent way to authenticate and authorize their apps.
